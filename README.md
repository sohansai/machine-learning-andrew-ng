# Machine Learning Specialization Coursera
This repository contains all of the courses in the Machine Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The specialization is divided into three courses:
1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

Each course has its own dedicated folder with a number of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the concepts covered in the course.
